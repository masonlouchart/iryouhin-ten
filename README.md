衣料品店 - Iryouhinten or IRH10 is a clothing shop website developed with [NextJs](https://nextjs.org) framework, [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) and the UI library [Ant Design](https://ant.design).

This small project was requested by a company during a recruiting process and is not meant to evolve. You can find more details about the assignment in the PDF file inside the "public" folder.

During the development I had the chance to discover and try:

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)
- Redux on Server-Side Rendering application
- Ant Design UI library

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Storybook

You can try some components of this project in standalone mode by using Storybook. Your browser will open automatically and if you stop and restart Storybook, the same tab will be used/focused.

```bash
npm run storybook
# or
yarn storybook
```
